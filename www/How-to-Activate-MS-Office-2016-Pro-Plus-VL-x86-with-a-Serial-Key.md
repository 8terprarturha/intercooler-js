## What is a Serial Key?
 
A serial key is a code that consists of 25 alphanumeric characters that can be used to unlock a software program or product. It is usually provided by the software developer or vendor when you purchase a legitimate copy of the software. A serial key can also be called a product key, activation key, license key, or registration key.
 
A serial key for MS Office 2016 Pro Plus VL x86 should look something like this:
 `XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX` 
You can enter this code during the installation process or after launching the software for the first time. The code will verify that you have a valid license to use the software and will activate all its features and functions.

If you have purchased MS Office 2016 Pro Plus VL x86 from an authorized reseller or distributor, you should receive a serial key along with your purchase receipt or confirmation email. You can also find your serial key on the product packaging or on a sticker attached to your device.

They may ask you to fill out surveys, download suspicious files, or enter your personal information in exchange for a serial key. These actions may expose your device to viruses, spyware, ransomware, or identity theft.
